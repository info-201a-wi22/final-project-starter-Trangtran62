## Abstract
Our main concern is how intersectionality contribute to shaping the system of oppression based on social identity. Specifically, our question is about how racial identity intertwined with gender to affect the current wage gap. To address this question, we will analyze the difference between income of individuals at the same educational level with different gender and racial identity.

**Keywords:** social justice, gender, race, wage gap

## Introduction
In this project, we will examine the additional effect of race on the existing gender wage gap, in an effort of highlighting the role of intersectionality when investigating systemic oppression. It is important, as justice will not be served if during our process of fighting against injustices, we overlook the struggles of some. Those are people who take on more than one marginalized identities. Specifically, in this project, we are focusing on women of color. Advocacy for a just system will benefit not one but everyone, as it is a "co-liberation" process. Through this project, we hope to break it down to better understand how each minoritized identity factors in the systemic injustices, regarding income. As such, we hope to shed light on the generational wealth gap.

## Design Situation
The topic that this project will focus on is the race and gender wage gap, research into the problem spaced showed that this is an issue across the US. One of the sources, ["Race and Gender Wage Gaps in the Market for Recent College Graduates"](https://alliance-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/f/lvbsh/TN_cdi_proquest_miscellaneous_61550254) shows that after controlling for education level and college major a study showed that white male graduates earned 10 to 15 percent more when compared to other graduates of different races and genders (Weinberger). The issues of the wage gap is global however, as even a cursory glance at the data set, which was sourced in Russia, shows that there are differences.
### Data source
The source of the data contributes to **project frame** will focus on and help tackle the wage gap inequality between races and genders in Russia.
### Human values
The **human values** behind this project are ones of equality across genders and races. One of the ways to fight against inequality is to show where the inequalities are and that is what this project aims to do.
### Direct and indirect stakeholders
The **direct stakeholders** of this project are the men and women that are affected by the wage gap due to their race and gender. Figure 1 from the source [“The Gender Wage Gap in the United States and Cross Nationally”](https://alliance-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/f/lvbsh/TN_cdi_proquest_journals_1616822208) shows the median distribution of wages and Blacks and Latinos/Latinas are just a few of the direct stakeholders that are negatively affected (Misra, Murray-Close). </p> The **indirect stakeholders** in this situation are those who are not in the working world at the moment but plan to join it. Even though they are not directly impacted by the current wage gap, once they start to work they will be and so even as ‘outsiders’ they still have a stake in the issue.
### Potential harms and benefits
While exposing the wage gap between genders and races has the **benefit** of bringing to light the inequalities of the working world, a possible **harm** arises through the more mainstream genders of "male" and "female." The terms "male" and "female" are used in all three sources including the source [“Ceteris non paribus: The intersectionality of gender, race, and region in the gender wage gap”](https://alliance-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/f/lvbsh/TN_cdi_gale_infotracacademiconefile_A523188234), and are also used in the data set, which erases the identities of those who are gender-fluid, non-binary, and the like and fails to recognize how identifying as a gender that is outside of the "mainstream" affects the wage inequality faced in the working world.

## Research questions
The three research questions are **How does racial identity affect income outcomes?**, **How does gender identity affect income outcomes?** and **How does the intersectionality of racial and gender identities affect income outcomes?** In this project these questions will be grouped by education level to control for wage difference between educational levels, as it is one of the closest proxies for income level. </p> The preliminary research done in part 2 clearly shows there is a wage gap between men and women as well as between races. However, while some may acknowledge that this is an issue they question the magnitude of it, their perception on who it affects and how it affects certain groups are skewed. They believe that the issue is not a systematic one but instead lies on the jobs people of different races and genders choose. These research questions are designed to investigate the magnitude of impacts that race and gender have on income levels, as well as how the intersection between them might impact educational outcomes differently.

## The Dataset
The dataset we used comes from [__Kaggle__](https://www.kaggle.com/ljanjughazyan/wages), an online platform where scientists and machine learning practitioners can share datasets. A Kaggle user uploaded the dataset four years ago and published it on Kaggle and made it accessible to the public. In making its dataset publicly available, the publisher aimed to assist other scholars and data scientists on Kaggle who are interested in creating models and conducting academic research. </p>This dataset includes a total of 1380 observations with six features. Several of them are __quantitative__ data such as ***earnings***, ***height***, ***ed(education level)***, and ***age***, while the others are __qualitative__ data such as ***sex*** and ***race***. Nonetheless, some elements of the quantitative data set were excluded from the dataset, such as the unit of the data. Also, the occupation of each data sample was not included in the dataset. For the data we used in this study, the race category consists of % white and % black, % hispanic and % of other races. Therefore, we expected to examine and gain insight from the wage gap between different gender, race and age groups. Each observation was composed of six attributes that demonstrated the potential wage gap between races, genders, and ages. Additionally, the publisher collected each sample's educational level and age besides race and earnings. Hence, the dataset not only represents people from different races but also could be categorized for different gender, age groups and education levels. As the dataset provides a wide range of sample's education levels and ages, we could better analyze each category and its relationships. </p>In terms of data validation, the dataset we used is held in a secure manner, as the dataset is from Kaggle, which datasets are posted and used for academic purposes only. The authenticity of Kaggle should be credited because Kaggle is an online website that provides a public data platform and a cloud-based workbench for data science. Hence, we obtained the dataset by downloading it from the website and uploading it to our repository.

## Findings 
Our main finding is that gender is the main determinant of the current wage gap in Russia, with male across all races earned significantly more than their female counterparts, with a similar level of education. Similarly, white people generally earned a higher median income than people of color. When looking at the joint effect of race and gender, we found that white male have much higher earning than males of other races. However, we found no effect within females groups, and males of color earned more than females of all races. Therefore, the effect of the intersection between race and gender on income is still unclear.

## Discussion
Since the data is restrained to Russia population only, there are cultural, social, and political factors specific to Russia that can affect the patterns found in data. Hence, it can't be generalized to the global population. However, the clear gender gap found in this dataset is supportive of the pattern found in the rest of the world. This highlights the universal issue with sexism in our patriarchal system, specifically the wage gap. This urge policy maker to make gender equity the center of their policies and laws. We need laws that protect women's work benefits and compensation, access to paid maternity leave, and educational rights. Those conditions also need to be extended to people of color. Especially, protection from harassment and discrimination in the work place is necessary for the equitable growth of women and people of color. 

## Conclusion 
Wage gap due to gender and racial identity is a social issue that prevents the equitable advancement of human as a whole. Human race can't go so far as long as some groups of people are excluded or discouraged from participating through an unjust compensation system. Data like this calls for more advocacy for the rights and equal treatment for women and people of color in the workplace.
